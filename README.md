# Thyroid-Detection-Cancer-Disease-
In this project I am woking on the Thyroid dataset and with the help of machine learning model calculating the disease prediction Accuracy.
                      Project Title & Description

4. Dataset
Mention the dataset source (if public, e.g., UCI, Kaggle, hospital dataset).
Features used: age, gender, medical history, lab results, etc.
Target variable: Recurrence (Yes/No).
Preprocessing steps: missing value handling, encoding categorical variables, scaling, feature engineering.

5. Approach
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified trends, correlations, and outliers.
Data preprocessing: cleaning, normalization, splitting train/test.
Feature engineering: derived medical/clinical features if applicable.


6. Models & Techniques
Algorithms tested (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN).
Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC).

7. Results
Best-performing model and its metrics.
Visualization of results (confusion matrix, ROC curve, feature importance).
